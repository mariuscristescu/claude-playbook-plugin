# Freehand

Enter freehand mode for user-directed work without gate pressure.

## Instructions

Run (via the project's wrapper — it resolves the same plugin copy the hooks run):

```bash
.claude/bin/tasks freehand
```

If that fails, try the local dev path:

```bash
PYTHONPATH=src python3 -m tasks.cli freehand
```

This will either:
- **If a task is active:** insert a Freehand block before the next unchecked gate
- **If no task is active:** create and activate a new task, then insert the Freehand block

Once in freehand mode:
- Wait for user instructions — don't work autonomously
- Drift counter and stop-hook blocking are suppressed
- When the user says done: check `[x] Freehand — <summary>`, run `tasks freehand log`, retro-add checked gates for work done
